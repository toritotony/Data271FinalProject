# DATA271 FINAL - EDA for Weather and Swainson Hawk Migration Patterns in California & Nevada

## Project Description
This project seeks to explore and evaluate the relationship between atmospheric and weather conditions and the migratory behavior of Swainson Hawks in California and Nevada. By integrating meteorological data and ecological records, the goal is to identify environmental triggers or correlations that influence migratory timing, direction, and population distribution. The project will utilize data sources from NOAA, Movebank, and GBIF to characterize climatic and atmospheric trends, and pair this with wildlife tracking and observational data to analyze how animal movement patterns change in response to these variables. Additionally, we'll be collecting data on their primary food source, Grasshoppers, in order to account for confounding factors and predator-prey relationships. Through this, we aim to better understand environmental stressors and inform sustainable conservation strategies.

Some considerations to keep in mind are the Koppen climate zones and variation of elevation across California, which are associated with diffrent types of habitats and are influenced by elevation. Consequently, I'll be relying on biodiversity reports on more Western state climate zones, and will likely collect geographical data to provide context when we view the movements of these animals. Since it will provide insight to their elevation and any obstructions that might isolate their movements, this will help interpret the tracking data more accurately. This will not only address accurate elevation but nearby residential areas that could disrupt the flight patterns of these hawks.

## Datasets
1. [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Center of Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) – national agency for daily weather forecasts, severe storm warnings, and climate monitoring to fisheries management, coastal restoration and supporting marine commerce
2. [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org) – international data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone open access to data about all types of life on Earth.
3. [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/) –  Movebank allows users to publish animal tracking datasets that have been uploaded to Movebank

## EDA Questions
- Which atmospheric variables (temperature, precipitation, wind) correlate most strongly with migration timing or intensity?
- Are there climate thresholds or seasonal shifts that predict migratory events?
- Can spatial–temporal mapping reveal significant trends over time?
- How might continued climate variability affect future migration predictability?
- Do predator–prey relationships between Swainson Hawks and Grasshoppers better explain some shifts than weather?
