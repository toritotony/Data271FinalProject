# DATA271 FINAL - Exploratory Data Analysis on Weather and Animal Migration Patterns in California

## Project Description
This project seeks to explore and evaluate the relationship between atmospheric and weather conditions and the migratory behavior of animal species in California. By integrating meteorological data and ecological records, the goal is to identify environmental triggers or correlations that influence migratory timing, direction, and population distribution. The project will utilize data sources from NOAA, Movebank, and CDFW to characterize climatic and atmospheric trends, and pair this with wildlife tracking and observational data to analyze how animal movement patterns change in response to these variables. Through this, we aim to better understand environmental stressors and inform sustainable conservation strategies.

## Datasets
1. [NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) – for historical and real-time climate data
2. [California Department Fish and Wildlife](https://data-cdfw.opendata.arcgis.com/search?q=barn%20owl&tags=species) – public CDFW spatial data, and discover related applications to discover species-specific details
3. [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/) – open-source animal movement data across species

## EDA Questions
- Which atmospheric variables (temperature, precipitation, wind) correlate most strongly with migration timing or intensity?
- Are there climate thresholds or seasonal shifts that predict migratory events?
- Can spatial–temporal mapping reveal significant trends over time?
- How might continued climate variability affect future migration predictability?
- Do predator–prey relationships better explain some shifts than weather alone?
