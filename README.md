# DATA271 FINAL - Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis on US Call for Service Data

### David

## Project Description
The goal of this project will be an extension to my project for ASA's Data Challenge which only tackled LA County, and its purpose is to evaluate the calls for service data across the nation provided publicly by their respective organizations over the span of time to identify trends, in order to offer alternative policing models and identify overallocations of resources to certain district areas. Paired with general census-collected information and weather reports, and similar information, this project will aim to identify the trends and use them to determine common stresses and causes to influx of these requests for emergency service.

## Datasets
1. [PD's Call for Service Data](https://humboldtgov.org/2161/Daily-CFS-Report) <-- example dataset source for HSO
2. [CALMAC Weather Files](https://www.calmac.org/weather.asp)
3. [Census Bureau Data](https://data.census.gov)

## EDA Questions
- How can we use a data-driven strategy to reduce the physical presence of officers, lower labor and resource costs, and shorten dispatch times when dealing with nonviolent calls?
- How can we combine insights from these calls—including their characteristics and any reported alleged crimes—with general census and weather data to better allocate resources and determine the necessary equipment for specific districts or situations, thereby minimizing unnecessary costs and overly aggressive responses?
- Can we identify a clear correlation between the environmental factors of cities and counties and the nature or frequency of calls for service, enabling us to predict these calls with reasonable accuracy?
