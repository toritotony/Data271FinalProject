# DATA271 FINAL - Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis on Real-Life Data Sets

## Project Goal

The principal goal of this project is to import real-life data sets, clean and tidy the data, and perform an exploratory data analysis. Throughout the project, you will demonstrate your data science capabilities by working with various data types and solving common data quality issues.

## Project Data

You will select one of the prompts below or propose your own (with the instructor's permissionâ€”ensure it aligns with Cal Poly Humboldt's mission). The data sets you use should contain key attributes that demonstrate the data science techniques learned during the course. You might even pick up new skills along the way, such as:

- Working with multiple data types (numerical, characters, dates, etc.)
- Handling non-normalized characteristics (e.g., punctuation, mixed case letters)
- Merging multiple data sets
- Cleaning unstructured data (addressing missing values, misaligned data with the data dictionary, etc.)
- Creating new variables (e.g., computing savings from income and expense data)
- Filtering data as necessary
- And much more!

## Project Prompts

You can choose from one of the following prompts or suggest your own prompt (subject to instructor's permission).

### Prompt 1: Homelessness

Each year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) produces a nationwide estimate of the number of people experiencing homelessness on a single night. This estimate is based on "point in time" (PIT) counts conducted in January and then typically released the following November. To estimate homelessness rates accurately, it is essential to understand the relative size of a specific Continuum of Care (CoC). A CoC is a regional or local planning body that coordinates housing services and funding for homeless families and individuals.

Key measures include:

- **Housing Inventory Count (HIC):** The number of beds dedicated to the homeless in the CoC.
- **Point-in-Time Count (PIT):** The number of people experiencing homelessness in the CoC on a single night in January.

Additional data considerations:

- **Population Data:** The total population of a CoC is not reported by HUD, but estimates are available from the U.S. Census Bureau (noting potential discrepancies in geographic boundaries between agencies).
- **Rental Costs:** Use Zillow's rent index for rental cost data.
- **Economic Indicators:** Median household income and the percentage of residents living in extreme poverty.
- **Other Measures:** You may consider additional factors, such as weather patterns, especially if they correlate with geographic locations exhibiting high unsheltered populations.

Potential analysis questions:

- What are the overall homelessness trends in America over the last decade?
- How do the trends differ when breaking the population into sheltered versus unsheltered groups?
- What are the trends for chronic versus nonchronic homelessness over time?
- After exploring national trends, how do these trends compare to those in California over the last decade? Does Humboldt mimic these trends?
- Focusing on California, what policies and legislation have been enacted in the last decade related to homelessness, and can you see any impact in your data from these policies?
- Are there additional policies you would suggest the State of California adopt based on your analysis?
