# DATA271 FINAL - Exploratory Data Analysis on Weather and Animal Migration Patterns in California

## Project Description
This project seeks to explore and evaluate the relationship between atmospheric and weather conditions and the migratory behavior of animal species in California. By integrating meteorological data and ecological records, the goal is to identify environmental triggers or correlations that influence migratory timing, direction, and population distribution. The project will utilize data sources from NOAA, Movebank, and CDFW to characterize climatic and atmospheric trends, and pair this with wildlife tracking and observational data to analyze how animal movement patterns change in response to these variables. Through this, we aim to better understand environmental stressors and inform sustainable conservation strategies.

## Datasets
1. [NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) – for historical and real-time climate data
2. [California Department Fish and Wildlife](https://data-cdfw.opendata.arcgis.com/search?q=barn%20owl&tags=species) – public CDFW spatial data, and discover related applications to discover species-specific details
3. [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/) – open-source animal movement data across species

## EDA Questions
- What weather patterns or atmospheric variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind patterns) correlate most strongly with migration timing or intensity for species in California?
- Are there identifiable climate thresholds or seasonal shifts that serve as predictors for migratory events?
- Can we spatially and temporally map migration patterns alongside climate variables to detect meaningful trends or changes over time?
- How might ongoing climate variability affect the predictability and consistency of migration behaviors in the near future?
- Are any migratory shifts better explained by predator-prey relationships than by weather factors, and can predator presence be used as a confounding control in determining causality?
